# Destiny Emblems
See and compare emblems obtained in Destiny 2 (*** IN PROGRESS***)

Destiny Emblems allows you to see all the emblems that you or any other player obtained in Destiny 2. Many of these emblems are linked to in-game objectives that you can examine and showcase.

At the moment, the project resides on [PythonAnywhere](http://aioros.pythonanywhere.com/destiny_emblems/), but the frontend is almost non-existent. You can however see a barebones version of your collection, either by searching in the previously linked page, or by accessing the URL directly like `http://aioros.pythonanywhere.com/destiny_emblems/player/your_gamertag`.
